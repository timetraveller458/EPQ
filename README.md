# EPQ
Prototype educational tool to explore the inner workings of image processing filters.
Please read the following instructions on how to use this prototype:
1. download all the files into a single folder
2. To run the program, double-click the file "main.py"
3. Here a window that looks like the photo in my write-up should appear
4. click on the buttons to see a filter
5. To close the windows PRESS ANY KEY (try not to click on the cross buttons as this is not necessary and a lot slower)
6. please don't click any other buttons whilst viewing a filter
7. To test the change image functionality, you can type "flower.jpg" into the input box

Thanks so much for your time :)
